## Code Uploaded to Google Cloud Functions

This folder contains the code that is currently deployed and running on Google Cloud Functions that enables headers to be securely stored in in Google Cloud Storage.
It currently does not allow for concurrency when multiple users try to upload headers simultaneously.  This is currently being addressed using a Google Cloud Storage mutex and will be included in the next update.
