## How to Run the External Adapter Locally

The external adapter can be ran locally for testing by using ```npm install``` to install all dependencies and ```yarn start``` to start the adapter.  Test requests can then be sent to https://localhost:8080.  The easiest way to send test requests is to modify the website frontend code in ../website/src/main.js and change the URL on line 19973 to "http://localhost:8080/".  The "simulator.html" page can then be opened locally to make test requests to the local instance of the external adapter.
